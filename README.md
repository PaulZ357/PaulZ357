### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Paul Zegarek, a current Software Engineering student at Quinnipiac University starting in Spring 2024. I have devoted myself to excellent opportunities that demonstrated my programming skills in real life settings. I have been previously a student at CT State Community Colleges from Fall 2021 through Fall 2023.
